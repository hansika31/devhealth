> A break at work is a period of time during a shift in which an employee is allowed to take time off from his/her job. It is a type of downtime. There are different types of breaks, and depending on the length and the employer's policies, the break may or may not be paid. (Wikipedia).

### Guilt

People often feel guilty if the stand up and take a break. This is especially true for people in tech and maybe the newcomers like interns or junior programmers. Hustling hard is the new norm and I don't have anything against hard work, if you play it smart.

### Benefits

Taking a break in your work hours is good for you. It keeps you to improve focus, keeps you from getting bored and helps you figure out a problem if you are stuck on it. The thing is that when you are frustrating and stressing out over a task you cannot solve, just taking a break and putting the task in your subconscious mind may help you solve it.

Walking, talking to coworkers, playing a video game can help you relax and the insights will come quicker when you are in a relaxed state.

> "Walk and talk". One type of I saw while visiting a client in US is the walking meeting type. Instead of siting in a conference room, you take a more active and personal approach and do a round or two around the block while discussing. It's great if you need to discuss how to solve a problem or come up with something more creative.

### Lunch break

TODO:

- lunch breaks are great way to relax, socialize and de-stress

It is common in some Asian countries to take an after lunch nap. This is true for factory workers, people in offices and you can also see people sleeping on subways and buses. The napping culture and the benefits from replenished energy after the short nap can be seen in some high tech companies as they provide sleeping pods or beds for employees.

### Methods

- you should take breaks every 2 hours at least
- walk or stretch during the break

- methods:
  pomodoro (timeboxing creates a bit of pressure, forcing you to be more productive),
  90-minute work blocks,
  52-17 work blocks,
