> Exhaustion of physical or emotional strength or motivation usually as a result of prolonged stress or frustration (Merriam-Webster).

**Why it happens**

One of the most common ways to get burned out is by working too much. You may do a lot of "crunch" time in your job or doing extra work on side projects (for example: being an opensource library maintainer).

Never ending learning curve, constantly having to put out fires, complex problems and deadlines is what helps fuel the burnout.

Combine this with lack of sleep, neglecting hobbies, friends, family and you are on the high-speed train to the burnout land.

**How it shows**

When you're getting close to burnout, you become irritable and get annoyed easily. Also feeling like you are not under control may be one of the symptoms.

When you live like that for a while, you may also more easily catch a cold, because of the degraded immune system.

When conditions for working become worse, the brightest and smartest employees tend to leave the company first.

Some of those will relocate or leave the field completely. This is unfortunate because fixing the reasons for burnout should be the responsibility of you and your employer.

**Remedies**

Here are some short and long term remedies, that help with the burnout. The goal should be to prevent it in the first place and establish a healthier company culture.

If you are experiencing burnout, take a break. Few days or weeks will help clear your head and start fresh.

After the break, identify the core problems that lead you to burnout. If this was connected to the work you do at the company, try to speak with the manager and explain why and how you feel. A good manager will appreciate your openness and you can find a solution together.

It's important to holistically fix the issues/symptoms that brought you to the burnout in the first place.

Value your time. Even if you are not a contractor, think of yourself as one. You are a craftsman, exchanging your expertise and time for pay. This way, you can build a sense of ownership over the work you do. Learn to say no to meaningless meetings and extra work.

Plan your days. You can create a to-do list for the night before or in the morning. This way, you know what you need to do and keep track of how much you can do in a day.

Have hobbies. Having hobbies other than code is important. Going to the gym, hiking, dancing are some of the activities that keep you active, clear your head and keep the balance of work and play.

If the burnout keeps on happening and you figure out that it's your job that is causing it, consider switching jobs. You are currently in a great place as a software developer and the demand is high. I'm sure you can find a company that values the health of its employees.
