> The definition of computer ergonomics is the practice of fitting the set up of the computer and the workspace to fit the user and the user's work needs in order to minimize physical stress on the computer user. (Your dictionary).

Being a developer usually consist of sitting in front of a computer for hours on end. You probably already know, but sitting is not the most natural position for humans to be in for a prolonged period of time. Small repetitive strain on the body during the day can cause people experiencing the consequences of prolonged sitting or bad posture with neck muscle strain or headaches.

Being aware and mindful of the posture you are in during work can help you reduce or completly releive the bad posture habits. Just getting new expensive standing desk will not solve all your problems.

### Computer ergonomics

The general principle of ergonomics is to keep body in the neutral position, avoiding being slouched over. Take time to set up your work environment, so you can feel better and be more productive later.

- Computer screen. Laptop screens are not the most ergonomically designed products, because screen is too low and we lean in towards it. Having an external monitor about arms length away is the first step towards a better workplace. Your eyes should be aligned about 5 cm (2 inches) below monitor height.
- Chair. Try different chairs, generally it should have good lumbar support, it should be taller than your neck and adjustable. Adjust it according to the height of your table, so your elbows are at 90 degree angle. Use a foot rest if you don't react the floor with your feet.
- Breaks. Our bodies are built to move, not to sit. Take regular breaks, it's recommended to do it every 30 minutes or so.
- Wrists. Using palms for support when typing can reduce risks of damaging the wrist.
- Light. Having sufficient light when working with a computer can help reduce eye strain.

### Standing desks

Sit-stand workstation is becoming really popular, especially in the tech offices. But just sitting all day will not be much better than sitting, so it's important to change the position often, it's suggested to do it every hour or so. There has been a study concluding that people who stand more at work tend to spend less time sitting at home, living more active lifestyle.

> In 2015, Denmark passed a law making sit-stand desks a legal requirement if the employee works more than 30h per week. This is a part of a reason why Danish design has been prevelant in the sit-stand desk industry.

### Equipment

- Mouse. If you have large hands, you should choose a bigger mouse. There are also some specially designed ergonomic mouses like [Logitech MX Vertical](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse).
- Apps. You can use apps like Stretchly that remind you to take breaks. You can find more about taking breaks in [previous article](https://devhealth.io/breaks/).

### Conclusion

Invest in your work space or ask your employeer to provide you with the best possible equipment. Taking good care of your body by minimizing the stress you put on it will help you in the long run.

Adding to that, doing regular exercise or going to a stretching sessions like Yoga or doing swiming sessions can help you relieve the tension.
