> "One way to boost our will power and focus is to manage our distractions instead of letting them manage us" (Daniel Goleman).

We get constantly triggered by the stimulus of distractions in a shape of notifications, ads and noises. As The New York Times reported, a UC Irvine study found that a typical office worker gets interrupted every 11 minutes â€“ yet it takes an average of 25 minutes to return to the original task.

To evaluate the importance of these stimuli, you can ask yourself if it's crucial and you really need to be bothered. If the answer is negative, it can wait until the pause.

**This is a practical guide on how to survive the distractions in both work and private life.**

### Workplace distractions

Let's see what distractions are most common in a typical work environment and how can we tame them.

- **Noise**. Working in an open office plan is connected with high decibel levels. Having a good pair of headphones, preferably noise canceling one, will help you tremendously. Having headphones on is a common sign thath you are focusing and don't want to be bothered. Asking coworkers questions or receiving feedback is essential, but it should be done in a non-blocking matter.
- **Smartphone**. Unless you are a mobile app developer, you can easily manage through the workday without your smartphone. Leave it in the backpack or set it to do not disturb mode. Constantly checking social media, messages or receiving calls will kill your line of thoughts and hurt the productivity.
- **Shallow work**. Prioritize your work and try to do the hardest thing first when you still have energy and mental focus. Check your email/instant messages in batches when you have a pause. You can try some of the methods like Pomodoro technique, where your work without distractions for 25 minutes and have a 5-minute break. Learn more about breaks in dedicated [article](https://devhealth.io/breaks/).
- **Clutter**. Having a clean office and desk with make focusing on work much easier.
- **Hunger**. Brain cells require twice as much energy as the other body parts. Make sure you are not starving when beginning work, otherwise you'll be easily distracted.

### Do not disturb mode

#### Windows

Focus assist is a built-in feature of Windows 10, access it under Settings - System - Focus Assist. It allows you to set the level of DnD (Off, Priority only where you define contacts or apps that can display notifications and Alarms only).

One useful feature is also to define an automatic rule where you can define a time period for focused work.

You can also toggle DnD mode on-demand in the Notifications panel on the right.

#### Instant messaging apps

If you use Slack or similar chat tool, check if they offer you to turn on DnD mode and mute unimportant channels.

#### Slack

You can turn on DnD mode by clicking on the bell icon. There's also an option to set a DnD schedule.
Channels that are not crucial to your work like "random" or "food" can be muted and will not show a notification.

> Nomophobia or no-mobile-phone fobia is a fear of being without access to a working cell phone.

### Social media

Social media is designed in the way that it makes so compeling to keep on scrolling the feed as you get dopamine shots for a reward. If you limit your social media usage to a certain time of the day, you can enjoy more productive days.

#### Apps

If you have no idea how much time you are productive and how much time is spent searching for the best "toast cat" images online, you can leverage the app called [Rescue Time](https://www.rescuetime.com/). It comes as a mobile and desktop app and it will track opened apps and sites.

[DistractOff](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/distractoff/hdnjpdhnjfiipibogpkeemefnldahcnk) is a Chrome browser plugin which helps you reduce the time spent on pages that are distracting. You can add a site and it will show you a banner "Shouldn't you be working" when visiting. You can still proceed to the page but must wait for a delay. If you had unconsciously visited the page, this will be a great help.

### Conclusion

You can improve your productivity by focusing on a single task at a time, reducing as many distractions as possible and pushing through the urge to check social media.

Steal attention from distractions and focus on deep work.
