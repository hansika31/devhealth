> "One way to boost our will power and focus is to manage our distractions instead of letting them manage us" (Daniel Goleman).

We get constantly triggered by stimulus in distractions. These can be notifications, ads, etc. As The New York Times reported, a UC Irvine study found that a typical office worker gets interrupted every 11 minutes â€“ yet it takes an average of 25 minutes to return to the original task.

To evaluate the importance of these stimulus, you can ask yourself if you really need to be bothered by this, is this crucial?. If it's not crucial, it can wait until the pause (the end of deep, focused work). Social media is designed in this way, it makes it so easy to keep on scrolling the feed, getting dopamine shots for reward. Limit your social media usage to a certain time of the day and enjoy more productive days.

This is a practical guide on how to survive all the distractions in the work and private life.

### Worplace distractions

Let's see what distractions are most common in a typical workplace environment and how can we remedy them.

- **Noise**. Working in a open office plan is connected with high decibel levels. Having a good pair of headphones, preferably noice cancelling one, will help you tremendously. A common thing in the companies is the culture if you have headphones on, you are doing deep work and should not be bothered. Having collegues to ask questions or receive feedback is great, but especially as knowledge workers, we should reduce the should tapping interruptions.
- **Smartphones**. If you are not a mobile app developer, you can easily manage through the workday without your smartphone. Leave it in the backpack or set it to do not disturb mode. Constantly checking social media, messages or receiving calls will kill your line of thoughts and hurt the productivity.
- **Shallow work**. Prioritize your work and try to do the hardest thing first when you still have energy and mental focus. Check your email / instant messages in batches when you have pause. You can try some of the methods like Pomodoro technique, where your work without distractions for 25 minutes and have 5 minute break.
- **Clutter**. Having a clean workspace with make learning / working much easier.
- **Hunger**. Brain cells require twice as much energy as the other body parts. Make sure you are not starving when beggining work, otherwise you'll be easily distracted.

- meetings (effective meeting, to the point, time bound
