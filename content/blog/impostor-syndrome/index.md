> Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud" (Wikipedia)

_Symptoms: Anxiety, perfectionism, self-doubt, fear of failure_

#### Comparing yourself to others

This may be one of the biggest reason you ever felt like an imposter. Social media platforms are usually the place to fuel impostor syndrome symptoms as most of the thing on these platforms are pictured as perfect, shiny and people are always happy.

You don’t see the downsides or the struggles that people go through and you feel worse if you are having a bad day. Just know that the vast majority of people have similar symptoms and you are not alone.

In fact Albert Einstein, Maya Angelou, Michelle Obama and many more all publicly expressed that they have often experienced feeling like a fraud in their career.

**Solution here would be to lower your consumption of social media and look back and be appreciative of what you have done already. You can always find and be grateful for the things you have already done and the people you work with.**

#### Being perfectionist

Being overly perfectionist may also impact the feeling of being a fraud when you are not accepting anything other than a perfect version of things and you are left with the feelings of self-doubt.

Being precise is not the same as being a perfectionist. You may get external validation and praise, but you still feel like an impostor.

This can be also seen in the tech sector, where things are moving at such a rapid pace, that knowing when a product or a feature is good enough is a really valuable trait.

#### Childhood

Those feelings may also be connected to your childhood if you experienced feelings of not being appreciated enough.

Slowly and steadily working on accepting the work you do and that many of your colleagues are in a similar situation can help you remedy it. There are also professionals you can talk to, they are there to help you.

#### Impostor syndrome never truly goes away, but you can do a few things to remedy the effect it has on you:

- Talk about it. You’ll see that you are not alone, be relieved and feel freer that you shared your secret.

- Look how far have you have come. Remember past achievements and embrace positive feedback you got.

- Re-framing ideas when in doubt ("_If I can do this, I will be able to help others in the future and work with people as motivated as I am._")

- Tell others when you appreciate their work. It will help them if they are experiencing impostor syndrome.

- **Don’t be so hard on yourself :)**
