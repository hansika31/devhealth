Do you ever get stressed about all the things you have to do in a day?

Following a well-proven system of managing tasks can help you remember what you have to do and prevent burning out because of overwork.

### Getting things done

I follow the Getting Things Done methodology of managing tasks for both work and personal projects. This method was popularized by David Allen and there is also a book with the same name, which I highly recommend to read.

The gist of the system is that it encourages you to put everything you want to get done in a system. The result is that you don't use your brain power to store tasks and events, but you use it for creative thinking and problem-solving.

You can store your project and tasks in either a physical notebook, Excel sheet or specialized software like Todoist. Put it into the system and don't worry about it.

### Organizing the list

- Every task you think of or want to do would go into the general list of tasks, called Inbox. Make the tasks actionable, instead of naming tasks like: birthday cake, name them: buy a birthday cake for Jane.

- Set up projects and assign tasks to them. I have projects called: work, home, reading list, blog, places to visit, shopping list and many more.

- Prioritize the tasks. You can use a scale from highest priority, which is priority p1 to lowest priority, p4. If you are doing a project for a customer, sync with the managers on what task should take the priority.

- If it's a really short task, which would take only a few minutes, do it right away.

### Daily tasks

Once you've prioritized the list, plan you days worth of tasks the night before or in the morning of the day. I plan for around 5-6 tasks a day, usually about 5 for work and 1-2 for personal projects.

- Start with the most important and urgent one. This way you'll avoid getting stuck on irrelevant tasks and you'll take advantage of the daily brain capacity. A great book about this topic would be Eat That Frog! from Brian Tracy.

### Weekly review

Keep the list of tasks fresh. I constantly add new tasks to the Inbox and once a week I'll go over the list and assign them to the correct project and schedule them.

If the task doesn't have a clear action to take, either remove them from the list or move them to a "someday" project.

### Combining with other software

If you use another ticketing system for your work tasks, something like Jira, Asana or Trello, you can integrate those with the task software you are using.

If it doesn't offer an integration, just copy the names of tasks to the todo list. It's a bit of annoyance, but it forces you to think more about the ticket. Jumping prematurely into the ticket without thinking about it and getting stuck in the middle of it is usually a bigger problem.

If you need to report your hours, you are a freelancer or your employer requires it, you can just copy the completed tasks from your to-do list.

### Conclusion

Like forming a habit, getting used to this methodology takes time. After a while of using it, you will feel freer because you offloaded the work from your brain to the system.

Let me know if you are using a similar tasks system. What are the biggest challenges you are facing?
