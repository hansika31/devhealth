I've always struggled to achieve the goals I've set. Fueled by the motivation and endorphins of writing down a goal, I've kept up for a few days, maybe weeks and then I didn't persist. I found out that you can improve by having a system to define measurable goals and doing regular reviews of the progress.

There are many goal setting techniques and one of the most interesting are OKRs.

### What are OKRs

> Objectives and key results (OKR) is a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes (Wikipedia).

Andy Grove, a former CEO of Intel, developed the idea of OKRs and they became widely adopted in the tech industry. OKRs can be defined either quarterly, annually or whatever time frame that works the best for you or your company.

#### Objectives

Objectives define the overall goal you want to achieve. Sample objective could be: "Increase traffic to DevHealth blog".

You can have multiple objectives you want to achieve within a quarter. To help really double down on the objectives, I chose only 3 objectives.

#### Key Results

Key Results are more fine-grained and tuned goals of each objective. An example of key results can be "Hit 500 visitors per month". These key results are measurable, meaning you can review the progress at the end of the time frame.

You can track the progress of these goals in the simple sheet like the one I prepared for you [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1He6qXcq8By8jjWEr_TuMm-hQRFLHQgkkREEieJnPg-Q) or in a special tool like [Weekdone](https://weekdone.com/okr-software).

#### Company OKRs

With OKRs, companies can align individual and team objectives with core corporate ones. OKRs are typically publicly shared within the company and thus you can easier align with other team members on collaboration.

Objectives should be defined from both top-down and bottom-up accordingly. The top-down strategy allows leadership to define goals and pass them to workers and bottom-up can help workers propose goals. This way, workers can help up shape objectives and key results for the company, which results in greater satisfaction, because everyone is working towards a common goal.

### How to set OKRs

- **Define objective(s)**. Objectives are high-level goals you want to achieve. Examples could be: "Increase traffic to DevHealth blog", "Increase recurring revenues" etc.
- **Define key results**. Define a few, I recommend up to 4, key results for each objective. A key result is a measurement of success. If your objective is "Increase traffic to DevHealth blog", your key results can be "Hit 500 visitors per month", "Publish 8 posts per quarter", "Publish at least 1 post per 2 weeks".
  - **Action Plan Summary**. Write down how you will measure your success for each key result. For an example of "Hit 500 visitors per month", we could look into Google Analytics monthly visitor statistics.
  - **Why?**. Writing why do you want to achieve this key result. Example, "Hit 500 visitors per month" has "Improve developer lives by teaching healthy mental habits".
- **Monthly grading**. Add an ability to provide a measurement of success for each key result. I added percentage input for each month. The provided sheet automatically calculates the total objective success by grading individual key results.
- **Review**. Review OKRs every 2 weeks and add grade at the end of the month. Succeeding in the monthly key results will give you the confidence to finish the objective.

### Conclusion

You are now ready to define and achieve your goals. Remember the difference between system and goals. You set a direction with a goal and systems to bring you there.

Target about 70% completion of OKR goals. That means we need to pick objectives that are slightly out of reach and uncomfortable. If we achieve 100% total score, we didn't pick hard enough goals and if we achieve 50% or less, we should define a more realistic goal.
