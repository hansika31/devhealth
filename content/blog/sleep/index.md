> A condition of body and mind which typically recurs for several hours every night, in which the nervous system is inactive, the eyes closed, the postural muscles relaxed, and consciousness practically suspended (Oxford dictionary).

We need from 7-9 hours of sleep per day, depends on the age, babies need more. Studies show that 1 out of every 2 adults in America is not getting the recommended hours of sleep. 1 out of 3 people is trying to survive on 6 hours or less. The average American adult is sleeping 6 hours and 31 minutes during the week, this used to be 7.9 hours in 1942.

During sleep at night, there is a sewage system in the brain that cleanses the brain of metabolic toxins that we accumulated during the day.

> Like humans, most animals sleep for at least a few hours. Dolphins are interesting because they are conscious breathers and in order to not drown, they need to go to the surface and breathe. This becomes an issue when you want to sleep. They float and shut half of its brain during sleep and keep the other half active to keep the basic functions active to not submerge under the water. They later repeat the process with the other half of the brain. 

### Circadian rhythm

A 24-hour internal clock, a hormone that regulates your sleepiness and wakefulness. It can vary a bit from person to person, but for most adults, there is a noticeable drop in energy from 1 pm to 3 pm and at night from 2 am to 4 am.

Outside factors like lightness and darkness can also impact on the internal clock. The brain sends a signal to the body to release melatonin which makes you.

### Sleep deprivation

It's interesting because human beings are the only species that deprive themselves of sleep and we are not wired to compensate for the lack of sleep. It's not like a bank. We can't accumulate a debt and hope to pay it off on the weekend.
