They are concious breathers, that means that in order to not drown, they need to go to the surface and breathe. This becomes issue when you want to sleep. Unlike humans, who rest in a complete cycle, they float and shut half of its brain during sleep and keep the other half active to keep the basic functions active to not submerge under the water. They later repeat the process with the other half of the brain.
