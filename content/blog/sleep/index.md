> A condition of body and mind which typically recurs for several hours every night, in which the nervous system is inactive, the eyes closed, the postural muscles relaxed, and consciousness practically suspended (Oxford dictionary).

Sleep is vital for us, it lets us function. Lack of sleep brings fatigue, less joy of life and grumpiness.

> Like humans, most animals sleep for at least a few hours. One interesting mammal that also sleep are dolphins. They are concious breathers, that means that in order to not drown, they need to go to the surface and breathe. This becomes issue when you want to sleep. Unlike humans, who rest in a complete cycle, they float and shut half of its brain during sleep and keep the other half active to keep the basic functions active to not submerge under the water. They later repeat the process with the other half of the brain. 

### Circadian rhythm

A 24-hour internal clock, also known as sleep/wake cycle. It regulates sleepiness and wakeness and it can vary a bit from person to person. For most adults, there is an noticable drop in energy from 1pm to 3pm and at night from 2am to 4am.

Outside factors like lightness and darkness can also impact on the internal clock. The brain sends a signal to the body to release melatonin which makes you.
